# Lies Of P Attack Calculator

A damage calculator that lets you plan builds and see scalings for unique weapons, standard weapons, and arm attachements, including modifiers from Cranks and Moonstone level.

This wouldn't be possible without the fantastic write up by [GrigLog](https://github.com/GrigLog/LoPGameplayData).\
Design inspired by the Elden Ring calculator by [ThomasJClark](https://eldenring.tclark.io).\
Hit modifier data provided by [Areswe's Lies of P Weapon Stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QzV3E4O10kvBmOGmJDrbA7ivV3ZJEVPV7biuSw93KL8/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

The code will look like actual garbage while I'm verifying numbers so bear with me.
